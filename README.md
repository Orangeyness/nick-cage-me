webapp
==========

Contains the website component of the system.
Using Symfony 2. To run it download [php composer](http://getcomposer.org/), browse to the webapp folder and run 
    php composer.phar update
    php app/console assets:install web
	php app/console server:run 

The site can then be viewed at localhost:8000. Unless I forgot a step...
